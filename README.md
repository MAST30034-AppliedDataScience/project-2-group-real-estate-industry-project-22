Step 1: Run `0_Scrape.ipynb` to scrape property data from Domain.com
Step 2: Run `1_Postcode_import.ipynb` to obtain the longitude and latitude values of suburbs
Step 3: Run `2_Properties.ipynb` notebook to clean and merge data obtained from Domain.com and ABS regional data 
Step 4: Run `3_Liveability_variables.ipynb` to scrape data relating to the grocery stores, hospitals and clinics and schools in the suburb
Step 5: Run `4_Quarterly_rent_analysis.ipynb` to process the dataframe, create liveability metrics and generate time series for the median weekly rent, number of available rental properties and to calculate the rental affordability index and growth rate of the suburbs
Step 6: Run `5_Liveability_index.ipynb` to create liveability and affordability metrics 
Step 7: Run `6_Preprocess_suburb_level.ipynb` to transform liveability metrics to per capita and perform preprocessing 
Step 8: Run `7_Geolocation.ipynb` to calculate the average distance to the cbd, nearest school and number of school in a postcode region
Step 9: Run `8_Regression.ipynb` to find the top 10 growing suburbs, explore feature correlation, analyse data distributions, train and test regression models, evaluate performance and find the most important features in the models
Step 10: Run `9_Visualise_map.ipynb` to create maps of properties based on number of bedrooms, price, number of healthcare services, grocery stores and schools,
Step 11: Read through `10_Summary.ipynb` notebook to gain a detailed overview of each notebook as well as the assumptions made in each section and the limitations we encountered
