    "## Affordability:\n",
    "For affordability, our idea was to make our data approachable as possible. We think that our data on affordability would benefit the masses. Hence, we avoided using complicated indices  such as the Rental Affordability Index (RAI) that many of the public would not be familiar with. Hence, we decided to visualize the most affordable suburbs by comparing the median rent with the median household income of Victorians. We believe that affordability may vary according to different property types. \n"

    "\n",
    "1.  When scraping data, as the RAM of our personal laptops are rather limited, we changed our code to separate the data into chunks. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Malvern properties were unable to be scrapped as it resulted in an error 404; a server-side issue. Hence we skipped the scraping for Malvern\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The postcodes dataframe resulted in Error 403 - Forbidden access.  Additional codes were written to bypass this layer of security. ‘\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scrape Notebook -  404 error produced when trying to scrape Malvern (postcode 3143). For this reason, Malvern ended up being skipped during the scraping. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scrape Notebook - Extremely inefficient and time consuming process (partly due to sleep timers) which delayed progress and limited the amount of data we were able to obtain.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Quarterly Rent Analysis Notebook \n",
    "The data contained merged suburbs where there would be multiple suburbs listed under one suburb name e.g. canterbury - surrey hills - mont albert for 3127. This made assigning postcodes to the data difficult and we had to choose which postcode to append to these listed suburbs. We decided based on personal opinion based on which suburb was more popular. Additionally postcodes for these suburbs had to be assigned manually.\n"

    "## Limitations:\n",
    "1.  Due to limitations of time, we were unable to explore more variables such crime rates, recreational facilities such as parks, gyms nearby or shopping malls, geographical properties such as pavement conditions or even the strength of local council policies of each suburb.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The free google maps API had limited requests per day/second. This caused a delay in our geolocation scaping and can be overcomed by using time delays in our code\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The main metric used to summarize the cost of rent in a suburb and the approximate income of renters within a region was the median, which is unable to capture the spread of the data. This limited the power of our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inability to access accurate historical rental data - this limited the power of our models and the predictions they made. \n",
    "\n",

    "1. Available property listings from Domain.com and external datasets (e.g. ABS datasets) are representative of the entire market in Victoria, even if some areas or types of properties are underrepresented.\n",
    "2. Rental prices and suburb growth over the next five years can be reasonably predicted based on the current market trends and the historical data available.\n",
    "3. Factors influencing population growth, income distribution, and housing demand (e.g., demographics, economic trends) will remain consistent, or evolve predictably, over the forecast period.\n",
    "4. External factors such as proximity to schools, parks, and public transportation are consistent predictors of rental prices and remain stable over the predicted time frame.\n",
    "5. When considering affordability of each suburb, we assumed that the median household income data from 2022 was still even applicable for 2024 rental prices. This is because we had a lack of data online concerning the 2024 median household income. "

    "## Recommendations:\n",
    "For young 20-ish, we think that rental affordability would be an utmost priority (weighted at 40%). This is followed by grocery convenience (20% weightage) as we think that most 20-ish might not have access to a car either due to a lack of funds or being an international student - commitment to a car might not be worth it if they frequently return home. Proximity to the city (20% weightage) was weighed slightly higher as well as we believe that young adults would prefer to live near the city for convenience, nightlife or work opportunities. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, for families, 3 or more bedrooms would be more ideal as it would provide more living space for children or furry friends to roam in. Grocery convenience (weighted at 20%) would be equally as important for families as for 20-ish. Education access (20% weightage) would be higher than that of 20-ishadults for the education of their young children. \n"
